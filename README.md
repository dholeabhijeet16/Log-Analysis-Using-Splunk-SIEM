# Log-Analysis-Using-Splunk-SIEM
This repository contains a collection of projects for analyzing various types of logs using Splunk SIEM. Each project provides a structured guide for uploading  log files, performing analysis, and gaining insights into specific types of log data.

Projects

1.[Analyzing DNS Log Files Using Splunk SIEM.md](https://github.com/dholeabhijeet16/Log-Analysis-Using-Splunk-SIEM/blob/main/Analyzing%20DNS%20Log%20Files%20Using%20Splunk%20SIEM.md): This project provides a step-by-step guide for analyzing DNS (Domain Name System) log files using Splunk SIEM. It covers uploading sample log files, extracting relevant fields, analyzing DNS query patterns, detecting anomalies, and monitoring DNS traffic.

2.[Analyzing HTTP Logs Using Splunk SIEM](https://github.com/dholeabhijeet16/Log-Analysis-Using-Splunk-SIEM/blob/main/Analyzing%20HTTP%20Log%20Files%20Using%20Splunk%20SIEM.md): This project outlines the process of analyzing HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) log files using Splunk SIEM. It covers uploading sample log files, extracting relevant fields, analyzing HTTP request patterns, detecting anomalies, and monitoring HTTP traffic.

3.[Analyzing SSH Logs Using Splunk SIEM](https://github.com/dholeabhijeet16/Log-Analysis-Using-Splunk-SIEM/blob/main/Analyzing%20SSH%20Log%20Files%20Using%20Splunk%20SIEM.md): This project provides a comprehensive guide for analyzing SSH (Secure Shell) log files using Splunk SIEM. It includes steps for uploading sample log files, extracting fields, analyzing SSH activity patterns, detecting anomalies, and correlating SSH logs with other data sources.

4.[Analyzing Tunnel Logs Using Splunk SIEM](https://github.com/dholeabhijeet16/Log-Analysis-Using-Splunk-SIEM/blob/main/Analyzing%20Tunnel%20Log%20Traffic%20Using%20Splunk%20SIEM.md) :This project demonstrates how to analyze tunnel log traffic (e.g., GRE, IPv4, IPv6) from Zeek IDS using Splunk SIEM. It covers uploading sample log files, performing analysis, detecting anomalies, and correlating tunnel logs with other logs for enhanced threat detection.

5.[Analyzing SMTP Logs Using Splunk SIEM](https://github.com/dholeabhijeet16/Log-Analysis-Using-Splunk-SIEM/blob/main/Analyzing%20Tunnel%20Log%20Traffic%20Using%20Splunk%20SIEM.md): This project provides a structured approach for analyzing SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) log files using Splunk SIEM. It includes steps for uploading sample log files, extracting fields, analyzing email traffic patterns, detecting anomalies, and monitoring SMTP activity.
